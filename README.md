# Quick-Start
You can use the data warehouse created from this repository "https://github.com/Noreilly95/sql-data-warehouse-project/tree/main." Alternatively, you can set it up more easily by running the "00_init_database" script in the master database on Microsoft SQL Server. This will initialize the necessary schema and tables for the project.
